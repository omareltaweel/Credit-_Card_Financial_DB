# Credit_Card_Financial_DB
Power BI Dashboard Project 
##Objective
The aim of this project is to create a comprehensive weekly dashboard for credit card operations. The dashboard provides real-time insights and key performance metrics, enabling stakeholders to monitor and analyze credit card transactions effectively.

##Tools Used
###MS SQL Server , Microsoft Excel,Microsoft Power BI 

##Steps
###Import Data into MS SQL Server
Load raw data related to credit card operations (e.g., transactions, user details, etc.) into MS SQL Server for efficient storage and query execution.

###Connecting Power BI to the Database
Establish a connection between Microsoft Power BI and the MS SQL Server database to fetch the required data for analysis.

###Data Cleaning
Clean the data to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and ensure data accuracy. This ensures the dashboard reflects correct and up-to-date information.

###Data Processing
Transform the data into a format suitable for reporting. This includes creating calculated columns, aggregating data for performance metrics, and setting up relationships between different data tables.

###Dashboard Creation
Using Microsoft Power BI, design the dashboard by visualizing the processed data. Create charts, graphs, and KPIs that provide real-time insights into key metrics such as transaction volumes, fraud detection rates, and customer spending patterns.

###Insights from Analysis
Analyze the data presented in the dashboard to extract actionable insights. Identify trends, anomalies, and performance bottlenecks to help stakeholders make informed decisions.
